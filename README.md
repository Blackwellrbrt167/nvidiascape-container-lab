# nvidiascape Vulnerability Lab (Memory-Based Container Escape) 

This project simulates a container breakot scenario based on *CVE-2025-23266 (NVIDIAScape)* IT shows how attackers may interact with the host system **without getting access to sensitve data** 

** What this Lab Covers:

Container Security and memory access

The Danger of running containers as root

Why privileged mode and host mounts matter

The importance of limiting attacker capabilities - even if they get inside the container

Blue Team Perspective: How can we protect an organization from a vulnerability like this. 

  ## Why This Matters 

Even if an attacker gets into a container, they may not get sensitive information.  This lab proves that **breach is possible - but damage can be prevented** with proper configuration 

This is one of many of my home labs to come and the focal point is to work towards mastery of Blue Team defense and real-world security.
